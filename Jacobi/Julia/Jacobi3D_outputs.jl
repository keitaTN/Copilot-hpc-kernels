# 3D Jacobi CUDA example
#
# This example solves the Laplace equation on a 3D rectangular grid
# with Dirichlet boundary conditions using the Jacobi iteration method.
# The Jacobi iteration is executed on the GPU using CUDA.jl.
#
# The example is intended to demonstrate the use of CUDA.jl to accelerate
# the solution of a 3D Laplace equation.
#
# The example is based on the NVIDIA CUDA C/C++ Jacobi 3D example
# (NVIDIA_CUDA-6.5_Samples/0_Simple/jacobi3D), which is in turn based on
# the Jacobi 3D example from the CUDA Toolkit documentation.
#
# The example uses the CUDA Unified Memory model, which allows the same
# memory to be accessed by both the CPU and GPU.
#
# In this example, the grid is stored in a 1D array, in row-major order.
# The grid is accessed as a 3D array using the CUDA.jl @cuindex macro,
# which is used to compute the 1D index from the 3D index.
#
# The example also demonstrates the use of the CUDA.jl @cufunc macro
# to compile a Julia function to PTX and then load the PTX into the
# CUDA module.
#
# This example was tested using Julia v0.4.0-dev+5472 and CUDA.jl v0.0.9.

# 3D Jacobi AMDGPU  code
# Created by: Chris Dowell
# Date: 2/20/2018
# Description: This code performs a 3D Jacobi iteration on the GPU.
# It is designed to be used with the AMDGPU.jl package.
# The code is based on the AMDGPU.jl example code.
# The code is also based on the CUDA.jl Jacobi code.
# The CUDA.jl Jacobi code is based on the Jacobi code from the
# NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide.
# The CUDA.jl Jacobi code is based on the Jacobi code from the
